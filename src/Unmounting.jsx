                The final stage of unmounting is essential as it doesnâ€™t require the component and gets unmounted from the DOM.<br></br> 
                As the final state, it is designed to produce the outcome via unmounting.

                <p>
                This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:</p>
<ul>
    <li>componentWillUnmount() -
This is the last method in the lifecycle as it pertains to the core unmounting <br></br>and removal from the DOM. The cleaning up of the component is also performed here. 
This is also used in <br></br>the logging out of users when they want to clear out the program from their browser.
